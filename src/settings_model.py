"""LMemM - the Settings window, as data and plain functions. No UI, all tested.

Everything you answered in setup, and a few things setup never asked, in one place: You, Apps,
Access, Privacy, General, Data. The window draws view() and forwards presses; apply() is the only
thing that changes a setting.

    G1  A setting takes effect the moment you change it, and says so in one sentence with Undo.
        There is no Save button and no "Apply".
    G2  The same rules as setup: a name needs a letter or digit (onboarding.valid_name); "only some
        apps" is a list of bundle ids and an empty list means every app (apps.py). Taking the last
        app off the list therefore means every app, and the sentence says so.
    G3  Access is read from macOS every time it is drawn, never remembered (onboarding S3), and has
        one button per row, the same ones setup has. Red is only for a permission that is off.
    G4  Privacy has two parts. What LMemM never reads is shown in words and cannot be turned off
        (password managers, banks and sign-in pages, private windows, password fields). Apps you add
        to "Never remember" are skipped before anything is captured, read or remembered.
    G5  Screenshots are kept 1, 3, 7 or 30 days (retention.py); the words say what the choice
        deletes and what it does not (the text and your notes stay).
    G6  Data shows where memory lives and how big it is, opens the file, and deletes everything the
        way the menu does (it asks, says what goes, and restarts). Nothing here deletes quietly.
    G7  A bad value is a sentence and changes nothing (the user block is only replaced whole).
