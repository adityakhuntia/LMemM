"""LMemM - where you are, read from the app itself (macOS Accessibility), not from pixels.

Every app tells the system what its focused control is called: WhatsApp's message box says
"Type a message to <chat>", Slack's "Message #<channel>", a browser has the page's URL.
That label is exact (no OCR noise) and reads in about a millisecond, so it is the pill's
way of knowing what you are on the instant you switch. Nothing is read from the
control's contents, only its name; the text you type is never touched.
