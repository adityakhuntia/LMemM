"""LMemM - first-run setup, as rules. Plain functions and one small state machine, no UI.

Five screens, in this order, one idea each:

    welcome   what LMemM is, in one line
    you       your first name (required) and what you mostly work on (optional)
    access    Voice notes, Accessibility, Screen Recording: live status, one step each
    try       press ⌃⌥N and see the note card (a rehearsal: nothing is stored)
    done      the pill appears

The ground rules (each one is tested in tests/test_onboarding.py):

    S1  Nothing can trap you. Every screen has Back except the first, and every screen's main
        button works, with one exception: Continue on "you" waits for a name.
    S2  Only a name is required, and the name, roles and apps can only change on their own screen. Roles, apps and every permission can be skipped and fixed later.
    S3  A permission's state is read from macOS, never remembered: granted, off, denied (voice
        only: macOS refused and will not ask again) or restart (Screen Recording was turned on
        but this process cannot see it until LMemM restarts). The row follows the state at once.
    S4  Screen Recording is last on its screen: the restart it may need comes after the others
        are done. A restart resumes on the screen you were on, with your answers.
    S5  "Only some apps" is a list of bundle ids (apps.py). An empty list means every app.
    S6  The setup record is written once, when you press Done (or "Not now" while a restart is
        pending): the "user" block of memory.json. Before that, only onboarding.json exists.
    S7  Setup runs once. A finished setup is never shown again by itself.
    S8  Everything on screen comes from view(): the window draws it and forwards presses; it
        decides nothing.

Plain Python with no PyObjC. The window is onboarding_ui.py; the macOS side is permissions.py.
