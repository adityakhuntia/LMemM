"""LMemM - which memory item a screen belongs to: the same thing, or a new one.

One rule for every app. The ref (understand.py) names WHERE you are: a URL, a window,
a draft slot. A verified source id (a Google Doc's id) is authoritative. Otherwise
what you TYPED there tells instances apart:

  - same place, and your earlier text is still on screen      -> the same thing
  - same place, your text vanished while you stayed on it (no scroll), or you come
    back and the spot you typed into is empty                -> a NEW thing that just
    looks the same (a second email, a new note, a fresh prompt)
  - conversations (anything that received text from others) never split
  - new place reached without navigating, while what you typed is still on screen,
    or the old place only had a placeholder name ("new", "untitled")
                                                             -> the same thing, whose
    URL/id/title changed (a draft got saved, a doc got a name)
  - anything else is a different thing: two chats in one WhatsApp tab are two
