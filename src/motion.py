"""LMemM - motion, in one place. Every animation goes through here so they share one curve, one set of
durations and one reduced-motion rule (docs: design/ui-audit-emilkowalski.md).

    ease     a strong ease-out, cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1): enters and exits start fast.
    pop      a card or dialog arrives: opacity and a small scale (never from zero), under 300 ms.
    step     the setup window changes screen: a short push forward, the other way for Back.
    none     things a person does many times a day, and anything started from the keyboard, do not animate.

Reduced motion (System Settings > Accessibility > Display) keeps the fades and drops the movement.
Only opacity and transform are ever animated. Every call is best effort: if the animation cannot
be made, the change simply happens, so motion can never stop a card from showing.
