"""LMemM - does the accessibility text explain the screen? If so, there is nothing to OCR.

No app is special-cased. The test is the same for every window on every Mac:

    1. Look at the pixels. A 16 px cell with strong contrast has "ink" (text, icons, lines).
    2. Look at the accessibility tree. Every node that has a position and a size says
       "I am drawn here": text we read, buttons, images, toolbars we skip on purpose, a small
       input box we do not read.
    3. Ink that no node accounts for is the gap. A terminal, a canvas, a game, a PDF page, an
       app with no accessibility: the gap is large, so the screen is read (OCR).
       A chat, a web page, a document, a settings window: the gap is small, so the text the
       tree already gave us is the answer and the 1-4 s OCR pass is skipped.

When in doubt it says "read the screen": an unsure answer is never a wrong one, only a slower one.
Pure functions on arrays and tuples: tested on any OS.
